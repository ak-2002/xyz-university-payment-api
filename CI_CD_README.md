# CI/CD Pipeline for XYZ University Payment API

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the XYZ University Payment API, implemented using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to work entirely within GitHub's ecosystem, providing automated building, testing, security scanning, and deployment packaging without requiring external services like Docker Hub or cloud providers.

## üìã Pipeline Components

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Release publications
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs:**
- **Build and Test**: Compiles code, runs unit tests, generates coverage reports
- **Security Scan**: Performs dependency and code security analysis
- **Package**: Creates deployment packages for different environments
- **Deploy**: Deploys to development and production environments
- **Notify**: Provides success/failure notifications

### 2. Manual Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Manual workflow dispatch with environment selection

**Features:**
- Interactive deployment to development, staging, or production
- Custom version tagging
- Environment-specific deployment packages

### 3. Security Scan Workflow (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Weekly scheduled scans (Mondays at 2 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Security Checks:**
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code analysis and formatting verification
- Secrets detection in code
- Security best practices validation

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create environments in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environments**
2. Create environments: `development`, `staging`, `production`
3. Configure protection rules as needed:
   - Required reviewers
   - Deployment branches
   - Wait timer

### 2. Required Secrets

No external secrets are required! The pipeline uses GitHub's built-in features:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided by GitHub Actions)
- Repository secrets (if needed for specific integrations)

### 3. Branch Protection Rules

Set up branch protection for `main` and `develop`:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
2. Add rule for `main` and `develop`
3. Enable:
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Require pull request reviews

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment

1. **Development**: Push to `develop` branch triggers automatic deployment
2. **Production**: Create a release to trigger production deployment

### Manual Deployment

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select **Deploy Application** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Choose environment and version
5. Click **Run workflow**

### Deployment Packages

The pipeline creates deployment packages that include:
- Compiled application
- Runtime dependencies
- Configuration files
- Deployment instructions

## üìä Artifacts and Reports

### Available Artifacts

1. **Test Results**: Unit test results and coverage reports
2. **Deployment Packages**: Ready-to-deploy application packages
3. **Security Reports**: Security scan results and recommendations

### Accessing Artifacts

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on a completed workflow run
3. Scroll down to **Artifacts** section
4. Download the required artifacts

## üîç Monitoring and Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoint

The application includes a health check endpoint:
```
GET /api/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### Pipeline Monitoring

Monitor pipeline health through:
- GitHub Actions dashboard
- Workflow run notifications
- Artifact availability
- Security scan reports

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

### 1. Add Hosting Service Integration

To integrate with specific hosting services, modify the deployment steps:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Azure App Service
  run: |
    # Add Azure deployment commands
    az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group my-rg --name my-app --src deployment-package.zip

- name: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  run: |
    # Add AWS deployment commands
    aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version --application-name my-app --version-label v1.0.0 --source-bundle S3Bucket="my-bucket",S3Key="deployment-package.zip"
```

### 2. Add Notification Systems

Integrate with notification services:

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

### 3. Add Performance Testing

Include performance testing in the pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Run Performance Tests
  run: |
    dotnet test xyz-university-payment-api/Tests/PerformanceTests/ --filter Category=Performance
```

## üîí Security Features

### Built-in Security Checks

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Identifies vulnerable packages
2. **Code Analysis**: Checks for security best practices
3. **Secrets Detection**: Scans for hardcoded secrets
4. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Validates secure communication

### Security Best Practices

- All deployments use HTTPS
- Authentication attributes are enforced
- No secrets in code
- Regular security scans
- Environment-specific configurations

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Pipeline Optimization

- Parallel job execution
- Caching of dependencies
- Incremental builds
- Efficient artifact management

### Application Optimization

- Release configuration builds
- Optimized deployment packages
- Health check monitoring
- Performance testing integration

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**: Check .NET version compatibility
2. **Test Failures**: Review test configuration and database setup
3. **Deployment Issues**: Verify environment configuration
4. **Security Scan Failures**: Address identified vulnerabilities

### Debug Steps

1. Check workflow run logs
2. Verify environment secrets
3. Test locally with same configuration
4. Review artifact contents
